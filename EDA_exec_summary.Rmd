In this exploratory data analysis, I examined the audio features and lyrics of 88 top K-pop tracks from 2019. I also compared the audio features of K-pop tracks alongside 11 other major genres: pop, rock, hip hop, dance, Latin, gospel, folk, Afropop, indie, R&B, and country. All tracks were obtained from "best of" playlists curated by Spotify in 2019.

According to my analysis, K-pop is a genre in which girl and boy groups, instead of solo artists, dominate the charts. K-pop artists like to release new music as singles rather than full-length albums. K-pop music tend to be loud, energetic, performance and audience-oriented, with a more produced and electronic sound. K-pop lyrics tend to be present-focused, with main themes such as love, partying, and bodily experiences, and Korean and English lyrics in K-pop portray slightly different emotions.
